Alone, these products have been unable to adequately manage grape diseases such as powdery mildew. To evaluate biological fungicides, two application regimes for control of Grape Powdery Mildew (GPM) were tested from 2021-2024, tank mixes and phenological alternations with micronized sulfur. Tank mixes of biological fungicides with below-label-rate sulfur (2.5lb/A in 2021, 2lb/A in 2022-2024) were tested to determine if adding sulfur to biofungicides could improve GPM management over sulfur alone. The bacterial based products Actinovate, Serenade ASO, Theia, Lifegard, Aviv, Double Nickel, and Serifel were evaluated with sulfur. In 2021 Serenade ASO tank mixes resulted in 16.7%-19.7% lower cluster severity than sulfur alone. The Theia tank mix resulted in significantly lower cluster severity by 30.6% and 38% when compared with sulfur alone in 2022 and 2023, respectively, but only resulted in lower leaf incidence in 2023. In 2024, GPM severity on clusters was significantly lower for both Double Nickel and Serifel tank mixes compared to sulfur alone. For phenological applications, sulfur was applied only during the bloom period, while biological fungicides were applied before and after bloom. In 2021 Aviv or Serenade ASO treatments resulted in average cluster severities between 13.8% and 18.2%. Lifegard resulted in significantly lower cluster severity than the sulfur control in 2023. In 2022 and 2023, Theia resulted in a lower AUDPC value than the sulfur only treatment, while in 2023 all Theia treatments resulted in cluster severity values that were significantly lower than the sulfur only treatment. Serenade ASO, Theia, Double Nickel, and Serifel augmented GPM control over sulfur alone and could offer grape growers alternatives to sulfur or synthetic fungicides for GPM control.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c4"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c4">Funding:</span><span class="c4 c11 c66">&nbsp;Integration of Intelligent Spray Technology into IPM Programs in Specialty Crop Production (USDA-ARS Project Number 58-5082-2-010).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c11"></span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c11"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c11"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c10" id="h.f12ozeoagv3a"><span>Pruning Wound Protection Against Grapevine Trunk Disease Is Essential For The Pacific Northwest Vineyards. </span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c4"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c4 c33">Achala N.

This leads to reduced translocation of water and nutrients to the trunk, eventually leading to stunted shoot growth and vine decline. We identified Botryosphaeria dieback as the most common GTD complex present in western Oregon vineyards followed by Esca diseases based on two years of field survey data. Of the 29 surveyed vineyards in the Willamette and Rogue Valley, we detected Botryosphaeria and Esca pathogens in 72% and 21% of the vineyards, respectively. These results were based on culture and PCR methods. To advance our understanding of the fungal microbiome, the samples were assayed with DNA metabarcoding. We detected 32 different fungal genera, of which 19 were GTD-related pathogens. Two uncommon GTD genera </span><span class="c4 c11">Truncatella</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c11">Seimatosporium</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;were detected from 100% of the samples. </span><span class="c4 c11">Phaeoacremonium</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c11">Phaeomoniella</span><span class="c21 c4">, two common Esca pathogens, were detected in nearly 70% of the samples and Botryosphaeria pathogens from nearly 60% of the samples. Under northern and southern Oregon conditions, Botryosphaeriaceae spores were detected between December and February in the Willamette Valley and between November and January in the Rogue Valley--typical pruning times in both regions. Thus, pruning wound protection is necessary to prevent vines from new infections every year. We evaluated pruning wound protection products in two-year field studies. Topsin, Rally, and VitiSeal were found to be the most effective pruning wound protectants in our studies. Furthermore, we identified that the application of systemic fungicides offers longer-term protection during rainy winter conditions in the Pacific Northwest compared to non-treated pruning wounds.</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c21 c4">Funding: Oregon Wine Board grant # 2019-2338 and 2022-2676; Northwest Center for Small Fruit Research grant # 59-2072-3-006 and 59-2072-1-012. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c11"></span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c11"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c11"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c10" id="h.l0mwmt6rp8y0"><span>Impact of </span><span class="c11">Pediococcus</span><span class="c14 c4">&nbsp;on Wine Chemical and Sensory Properties</span></h3><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span>Esther Wanjohi</span><span class="c18">1</span><span>, Elizabeth Tomasino</span><span class="c18">2</span><span>, Jaewoo Choi</span><span class="c18">3</span><span>, Liping Yang</span><span class="c18">4</span><span>, and James Osborne</span><span class="c18">5<br>1</span><span>Graduate Research Assistant, </span><span class="c18">2</span><span>Associate Professor, and </span><span class="c18">5</span><span>Professor, Department of Food Science and Technology; </span><span class="c18">3</span><span>Senior Research Associate and </span><span class="c18">4</span><span>Senior Faculty Research Assistant, Department of Chemistry, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331.<br>*Corresponding Author: </span><span class="c57"><a class="c20" href="mailto:james.osborne@oregonstate.edu">james.osborne@oregonstate.edu</a></span><span class="c0">, 541-737-6494</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c11">Pediococci</span><span>&nbsp;have been isolated from wines worldwide but their specific impact on wine quality is not well described.

These potent attributes can mask desirable traits, like fruity and floral notes, generally leading to decreased wine quality. While the chemical and sensory effects of smoke on wine have been well researched, few studies have investigated consumer response. The aims of this research were to explore how consumers respond to smoke-impacted wine, confirm whether clusters of consumers exist and characterize them by their liking of smoky flavors in foods/beverages and subjective wine knowledge, and explore how different label concepts influence these responses. Additionally, this work utilized consumers with less exposure to the effects of smoke impact on wine, with New Zealand currently not experiencing the impact of wildfires that has been seen in Australia and the United States. Participants evaluated five blends of a smoke-impacted wine, and the wine presented with four different label concepts. Consumers responded to overall liking, emotions, and perceived attributes. The results identified two clusters of consumers: one disliking the smoke-impacted wine and the other liking the wine. Smoke-likers had a higher liking for smoky flavors in general, along with a higher level of subjective wine knowledge. The smoke-disliker cluster was more susceptible to the impacts of the labels, with the wine being significantly more liked and altering the elicited emotions and attributes. This research provides vital information to the wine industry as they face the challenge of future wildfire years. These findings suggest that the distinct sensory profile of smoke-impacted wines may not universally deter consumers and how labelling can impact this perception.

All these qualities may directly or indirectly affect production. However, little research has been done in the modern era to see how these rootstocks can affect fruit set. Thus, this study was initiated to investigate the interaction effect of rootstock on fruit set of two leading red wine grape cultivars under field conditions. The study was initiated in 2024 at OSU&rsquo;s Southern Oregon Research and Extension Center in a 2.2-acre vineyard, where 10 rootstocks of both scion cultivars were planted in 2019. The two scion cultivars &ndash; Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon &ndash; grafted to 10 different rootstocks were planted in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with a split-plot factorial treatment structure with five replications. Scion cultivars were arranged in main plots, and rootstocks were in subplots. Experimental units consisted of three vines. Fruit set was determined by covering two inflorescences per vine with mesh bags prior to flowering and collected one week after fruit set. The caps were weighed, and the berries were counted in the lab. Results showed that there was a significant interaction effect between rootstock and scion (</span><span class="c11">p</span><span>&nbsp;&lt; 0.0001)</span><span class="c11">.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Fruit set in Pinot noir showed more significant variation, ranging from 46.6% to 29.6%, while Cabernet Sauvignon ranged from 38.3% to 28.1%.

In addition, there was a statistically significant linear decrease in the percent fruit set with increasing flower number per inflorescence.

However, the degree of rootstock impact varies with vineyard environment, and there is limited quantitative data on scion&ndash;rootstock interactions under field conditions in Southern Oregon. This study used a rootstock trial at the Southern Oregon Research and Extension Center (SOREC) to evaluate how scion and rootstock interact to influence phenological development. The trial was conducted in a 2.2-acre vineyard planted in 2019 with two scion cultivars &ndash; Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon &ndash; grafted onto 10 rootstocks, each replicated five times. Field plots followed a randomized complete block design with a split-plot factorial structure: scions were randomized in main plots, rootstocks in subplots. Each experimental unit consisted of three vines. Prior to budbreak, two spurs per vine were flagged and monitored weekly from March through August. Phenological stages were recorded using the modified Eichorn-Lorenz system. There were no statistically significant interactions between scion and rootstock at any phenological stage. Cabernet Sauvignon developed significantly later than Pinot noir across all stages (p &lt; 0.001), with budbreak, bloom, and veraison occurring four, five, and eight days later, respectively. Rootstock had a smaller but significant effect on bloom and veraison only (p &lt; 0.05), with differences among rootstocks ranging from 1&ndash;3 days. First-year results indicate that scion cultivar is the primary driver of phenological development, with minimal influence from rootstock and no interaction between the two. The study will continue in subsequent years to validate and expand on these findings.</span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Funding: College of Agricultural Sciences Branch Experiment Station (BES) Internship Program, OWRI-EFF Undergraduate Scholars Program, Oregon Wine Board, and California Grape Rootstock Improvement Commission</span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c27 c10" id="h.ns8x1tiszu6c"><span class="c14 c4">Pinot Noir Potassium Status Varies With Different Rootstocks</span></h3><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Grace E.

Most Oregon vineyards are planted to vines grafted on three primary rootstocks: 3309C, Riparia Gloire, and 101-14. Rootstocks with </span><span class="c11">V. rupestris</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;parentage (101-14 and 3309C) are known to have high K affinity. High K concentration in must can reduce titratable acidity and raise pH, and pH&gt;3.65 can jeopardize microbial stability during fermentation. To understand the relationship between rootstocks and potassium status, Pinot noir (W&auml;denswil, FPS 2A) on eight rootstocks and own-rooted vines were evaluated during 2024. Rootstocks included 3309C, 1103P, 44-53, 5BB, Schwarzmann, 101-14, Riparia Gloire, 420A, and own-rooted vines. Leaf blade and petiole K were measured at verasion, and juice K concentration was measured from ripening to harvest. Data were also collected on vine growth, yield, pruning weights, and fruit composition. Results show 1103P had higher juice K concentrations than Riparia Gloire, 3309C, and 101-14 at harvest. Pinot noir on 44-53 and 3309C had higher verasion leaf blade K concentrations compared to Pinot noir on 1103P, Riparia Gloire, 420A, and 5BB. In fact, Pinot noir on 5BB reached near deficient leaf blade K concentrations at verasion. When comparing all rootstock combinations, higher yield was correlated with higher juice K. Pruning weight was negatively correlated with verasion leaf blade K concentration, and this is largely explained by 5BB with larger vine sizes and lower K affinity. To monitor K in Pinot noir juice during ripening, a subset of four rootstocks were selected (101-14, 3309C, 420A, and Riparia Gloire), representing different K affinities, but there were no differences. This work will continue for two more seasons. Information from this research is building upon regional rootstock performance metrics that will assist growers in selecting rootstocks for future plantings. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Funding source: Oregon Wine Board</span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c27 c10" id="h.lvz86jeke8hx"><span class="c14 c4">Evaluating Rootstocks For Cool-Climate White Wine Grape Production</span></h3><p class="c28 c51"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Abigail G.

Alternative rootstocks for the region are of interest as growers consider future plantings. To understand rootstock impact on vine growth and productivity under dry-farmed conditions, a three-year research trial (2023-2025) is being conducted at OSU Woodhall Vineyard. The trial was planted in 1997 to Chardonnay (Dijon 95) and Pinot gris (Colmar 146) grafted to nine rootstocks (101-14, 3309, Riparia Gloire (RG), 110R, 420A, 5BB, Gravesac, 44-53 and SO4) and own-rooted vines. Results from 2023-2024 show no differences in bud break, bloom, or veraison. However, rootstock led to differences in cultivar yield, vegetative vigor, tissue macronutrients and fruit composition. The highest vine size and yields were on 5BB, SO4, and 420A while vines on RG, 3309, and 44-53 had the smallest vine size and yields. Vines on these latter rootstocks generally had statistically higher total soluble solids (TSS), higher pH, and lower titratable acidity (TA) at harvest. Vines on RG and 44-53 had higher TSS (23.8-23.9&deg;Brix) than vines on 420A, SO4, 5BB, 110R, and 101-14 (21.0-22.6&deg;Brix). Fewer differences were observed for pH and TA, though vines on RG had higher pH (3.43 vs. 3.31) and lower TA (5.5 vs. 7.2 g/L) than 420A. Cultivars differed in rootstock response to water stress, but vines on RG, 3309, and 110R had the highest water stress while vines on 5BB and SO4 experienced the least water stress. Stem water potential was positively correlated with pruning weight and leaf area index for both cultivars, showing less water stress in vines with larger canopies. There were differences in veraison leaf blade potassium but not nitrogen. These macronutrient differences may be explained by rootstock impacts on vine size and fruit yield and will be explored further. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Funding: Northwest Center for Small Fruits Research</span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c22 c8 c10" id="h.lqyu0pph5wu"><span class="c14 c4">Influence of Delayed Irrigation Initiation Time on Pinot noir Wine Composition and Volatile Compounds </span></h3><p class="c7 c8"><span><br></span><span>Tingting Ye</span><span class="c18">1</span><span>, Alexander Levin</span><span class="c18">2</span><span>, Yanping L Qian</span><span class="c18">3</span><span>, Michael Qian</span><span class="c18">4*</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c18">1</span><span class="c0">Graduate Research Assistant, Department of Food Science and Technology, Oregon State University, 100 Wiegand Hall,3051 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c18">2</span><span class="c0">Associate Professor, Department of Horticulture, Oregon State University, 4017 Agriculture and Life Science Building, 2750 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c18">3</span><span class="c0">Associate Professor (Sr. Res), Department of Crop and Soil Science, Oregon State University, 109 Crop Science Building, 3050 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c18">4</span><span>Professor, Department of Food Science and Technology, Oregon State University, 100 Wiegand Hall, 3051 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 </span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c0">* Corresponding Author: michael.qian@oregonstate.edu, 541-737-9114</span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22 c8"><span class="c0">The influence of delayed irrigation initiation time on Pinot noir wine composition was investigated from 2021 to 2023 in three sub-regions with different soil types and climates in Southern Oregon. Grapevines were irrigated with 70% evapotranspiration (ETc) at different initiation times based on normalized vine water status thresholds (&Delta;SWP) throughout berry development. The &Delta;SWP was defined as the departure of measure midday stem water potential from the calculated non-water-stressed baseline (&Delta;SWP = SWPns &ndash; SWPabs). Total phenolic contents, phenolic composition, and volatile compounds in wine were analyzed. The results showed a reduction in total phenolic contents in wines with delayed irrigation initiation time in three regions in all three vintages, and an overall downward trend in total monomeric anthocyanin contents in Ashland and Eagle Point but an opposite trend in Jacksonville. Delayed irrigation initiation time greatly impacted volatile compounds in wines, although geographic locations and vintages were more impactful. Methoxypyrazines, associated with herbal, green aroma attribute, decreased with delayed irrigation in Jacksonville and Eagle Point in all three vintages, but varied in Ashland. &nbsp;Total esters and total terpene alcohols increased in response to delayed irrigation initiation time in all three sites. &beta;-damascenone and &beta;-ionone, associated with berry aroma attribute, increased in response to delayed irrigation initiation time in Jacksonville and Ashland across three years, but not in Eagle Point. Increase in fruity esters, &beta;-damascenone and &beta;-ionone, and decrease in methoxypyrazines, could suggest wines with fruitier, berry-like aroma attributes. </span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22 c8"><span class="c0">Funding: The financial support provided by USDA-ARS-Northwest Small Fruit Research.</span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c27 c10" id="h.xlhx5nygbj4k"><span class="c14 c4">The State Of Vineyard Nutrition In The Us: Survey Findings And Future Directions</span></h3><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Karmandeep K.

The High-Resolution (HiRes) Vineyard Nutrient Management Project aimed to develop new nutrient monitoring methods for precision nutrient management. In 2021, an industry-wide survey was conducted across 25 US states, collecting responses from 322 commercial grape growers representing 176,000 vineyard acres. Results revealed that 57% of respondents use both soil and tissue testing to determine vineyard nutrient status rather than using soil or plant based analyses alone. A total of 75% of respondents apply fertilizers annually, focusing on nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and boron (B) as top nutrients of concern, but this varied by state. Producers followed standard recommended tissue and soil sampling methods and laboratory analyses to monitor vineyard nutrition, but samples represented a large area of 1 to 5 acres on average. Industry standard sampling methods do not provide data on spatial variability in vineyards, leading to generalized management practices and are difficult to integrate into precision agriculture applications. The HiRes Project team worked over the past four years to develop sensor technology to improve nutrient sampling resolution that can be used in precision nutrient management. These efforts built upon remote and proximal sensing methods, which were used by only 17% of respondents in the 2021 survey. The cited barriers to adoption were perceived high costs and lack of awareness and technical expertise. To build on these findings, industry focus group meetings are being conducted in spring 2025 across five states (CA, OR, WA, NY and VA) to gain insights into grower decision-making processes and perceived challenges. Results will be used by the HiRes Vineyard Nutrition Team to refine outputs to ensure that vineyard nutrient management approaches are both practical and sustainable for growers across the US.</span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Funding: This research is funded through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture&rsquo;s (NIFA) Specialty Crop Research Initiative Coordinated Agricultural Projects (CAP) grant.

The lack of a suitable treatment necessitates the development of novel control strategies. During infection, virus proteins must interact with host proteins to carry out essential steps of infection. Disruptions in these protein interactions lead to the failure of viral infection. The first step to exploring these host genes as potential targets for gene editing is the systematic identification of pro-viral host factors. Our study focuses on identifying host factors of four GRBV proteins, C1 (replication associate protein), C2, C3, and C1:2 (full-length replicase). Our approach used the yeast-two-hybrid system with viral proteins as baits, screened against a prey library of grapevine cDNA to identify interactors in vitro. The promising interactors of each bait protein will then be validated in planta using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) in microvine cells. In vitro screenings of all four GRBV proteins have been conducted. From these screens, eight promising host interactors of GRBV have been identified. Positive controls have been validated for the in-planta assay, and preparation of the experimental vectors has been initiated. Overall, identifying these interactors has generated insightful information about the strategy of GRBV to promote its replication and spread. This could provide a future roadmap for developing GRBV resistance via gene editing or topical application of RNA to trigger gene silencing.<br></span></p><p class="c7 c8 c36"><span class="c0">Funding: Not specified.</span></p><p class="c3 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c3 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c36 c34" id="h.7rok99kl7iby"><span class="c14 c31"></span></h3><h3 class="c7 c8 c10" id="h.b3pb4vrcvmv4"><span class="c14 c4">Nature Vs Nurture: Evaluating The Impact Of Cytokinins And Developmental Regulator Genes On Regeneration In Grapevine</span></h3><h3 class="c7 c8 c10 c34" id="h.9723iq35sq2t"><span class="c14 c4"></span></h3><p class="c22 c8"><span>Kyra Hopper</span><span class="c18">1</span><span>, Ken Donsky</span><span class="c18">2</span><span>*, Laurent Deluc</span><span class="c18">3,4</span></p><p class="c22 c8"><span class="c18">1</span><span>Undergraduate Research Assistant, Department of Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, United States, </span><span class="c18">2</span><span>Graduate Student, Department of Horticulture, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, United States, </span><span class="c18">3</span><span>Associate Professor, Department of Horticulture, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, United States, </span><span class="c18">4</span><span class="c0">Oregon Wine Research Institute, Department of Horticulture, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, United States</span></p><p class="c8 c22"><span>*Corresponding Author: </span><span class="c76">donskyk@oregonstate.edu</span><span class="c0">, 541-737-2982</span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span>Establishing an efficient </span><span class="c11">in vitro </span><span>regeneration system is integral for plant genetic transformation studies.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved plant defense mechanism triggered by various pathogens, including viruses, but its role remains poorly documented, specifically in GRBV suppression. RNAi can be enhanced through spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS), where double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting the pathogen is ectopically applied to the plant, offering a non-transgenic and sustainable solution for viral control. Our prior research identified nine GRBV genomic hotspots (HS) targeted by grapevine RNAi during the early stages of infection. Building on this, we tested the silencing effectiveness of dsRNA derived from these HS (HS-dsRNA) in GRBV-infected tissue-culture plants using a root-soaking method. This approach led to a significant decrease in viral gene expression at 12- and 24-days after treatment. We then explored the potential for these dsRNA molecules to enable systemic uptake and silencing in greenhouse-grown plants. When fluoro-labeled HS-dsRNA was applied via low-pressure spray, both treated and untreated leaves showed uptake within 48 hours and sustained presence at 7- and 14-days post-application. To evaluate silencing efficiency, we will spray GRBV-infected plants with HS-dsRNA and measure viral gene expression using qPCR at 1-, 2-, and 3-months post-treatment. In addition, long-term studies (6&ndash;12 months) are being conducted to determine the optimal application frequency for sustained viral suppression over a season. These findings support the potential of dsRNA-triggered RNAi as a sustainable strategy for managing GRBV.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c23"></span></p><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c42"></span></p><h1 class="c19 c8 c27" id="h.zbprrdyr4y8o"><span class="c14 c23">&#127863; Enology</span></h1><hr><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c23"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c10" id="h.4cufymfk13je"><span class="c14 c4"><br>Evaluating the Sensory Impacts of Fermentation Techniques on Tropical Fruit Aroma in Chardonnay Wines</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c31"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span>Mara Anton</span><span class="c18">1</span><span>, Chanda Miller</span><span class="c18">2</span><span>, Camilla Sartori</span><span class="c18">3</span><span>, Elizabeth Tomasino</span><span class="c18">4</span><span class="c0">*</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c18">1</span><span>OWRI Undergraduate Research Scholar, </span><span class="c18">2</span><span>Graduate Research Assistant, </span><span class="c18">3</span><span>Lab Sensory Manager, </span><span class="c18">4</span><span class="c0">Professor, Department of Food Science and Technology, Oregon State University, 220 Wiegand Hall, 3051 SW Campus Way, Corvallis OR 97331</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c0">*Corresponding Author: Elizabeth.tomasino@oregonstate.edu</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c0">Tropical fruit aromas in white wine have been identified as positive sensory qualities by wine consumers.

This work continues on from the first year of techniques to see if these treatments result in similar sensory qualities for an additional vintage. Chardonnay grapes from the 2024 vintage from the Willamette Valley, Oregon were used. Five treatments were used; (1) controls (no skin contact) with fermentation at 13&deg;C, (2) control fermentation at 20&deg;C, (3) 24 hours Skin Contact with fermentation at 20&deg;C, (4) Control (no skin contact) fermentation at 20&deg;C for 5 days then 13&deg;C thereafter, (5) 18 hours Skin Contact with fermentation at 20&deg;C for 5 days then 13&deg;C thereafter. Sensory evaluations were conducted using a consumer panel to include overall acceptance, emotional response, and a check-all-that-apply (CATA) characterization for aroma description that contains 19 aroma target words. Samples from each treatment were taken at the time of sensory evaluations to identify and quantify aroma compounds present that have previously been identified as contributors to the target aromas being evaluated in the CATA characterization. These results will then be compared to sensory evaluation measurements to provide both a chemical and sensory profile of the six treatments and to similar results from a previous vintage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c0">Funding: Erath Family Foundation OWRI Undergraduate Scholars Program</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c21 c23"></span></p><p class="c3" id="h.ylwejx1989jy"><span class="c14 c31"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c10" id="h.azw5km8ibcvr"><span class="c14 c4">Pediococcus Diversity In Wines From Oregon, Washington, And California</span></h3><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span>Peyton Childers</span><span class="c18">1</span><span>, and James Osborne</span><span class="c24 c18">2</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c18">1</span><span>Undergraduate research scholar, </span><span class="c18">2</span><span class="c0">Professor, Director Oregon Wine Research Institute, Department of Food Science and Technology, Oregon State University, 108A Wiegand Hall, 3051 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331.</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span>*Corresponding Author: </span><span class="c57"><a class="c20" href="mailto:james.osborne@oregonstate.edu">james.osborne@oregonstate.edu</a></span><span class="c0">, 541-737-6494</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c11">Pediococci</span><span>&nbsp;have been isolated from wines worldwide, but their specific impact on wine quality is not well described.

In anaerobic environments, reductive aromas are attributed to the formation of methyl and ethyl thiols which are unpleasant to the consumer. Additionally, recent events of wildfires in various wine-growing regions led to smoke taint, which adversely affected the wine&#39;s overall quality. Thiophenols are among the compounds responsible for smoke taint. Therefore, we believe the ability to selectively remove specific amounts of thiols could improve the wine&#39;s quality and highlight specific aromas. An inert closed-loop system was devised, and simple solutions were tested as a proof of concept on ethyl thiol and thiophenol. The thiol was added to a buffer solution in a source flask, while 5,5&rsquo;-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), a known thiol quantification compound, was used to trap the volatile thiols in a separate flask. This system ensured that the trapping solution would not mix with the initial solution/wine. Aliquots were drawn from the source and trapping flask and the absorbance was taken with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer to quantify the amount of thiol trapped. The parameters suspected to influence the trapping efficiency were investigated and optimized for future experiments. Thiols could be trapped with the proposed non-contact system. After 60 minutes, approximately 85% of the ethyl thiol added was trapped. While the heavier thiophenol took longer to trap, the trapping efficiency could be increased by raising the temperature or introducing a nebulizer. Removing volatile thiols associated with reduction or smoke-taint in wines would remove off-flavors associated, thereby improving the wine quality. This research is a stepping stone to further develop technologies that can be integrated into the wine-making process to improve thiol-related off-aromas in wines. </span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Funding: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Agricultural Research Foundation &ndash; Continuing Researcher Support Program </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">ARS Plant Gene Expression Center </span></p><p class="c7 c28 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c7 c28 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c10" id="h.bdgulaa2cdxv"><span class="c4">Technical Pinot Noir Wine Tasting Reveals Connection Between Mouthfeel And Wine Preference Regardless Of Crop Thinning</span></h3><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c31"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Ainsley H.

The goal of this practice is to achieve low target yields that are often assumed to impact fruit and wine quality. After eight years of vineyard crop load research, project wines were shared with Oregon wine industry professionals to determine whether crop thinning and wine sensory perception are related. In 2019, a double-blind technical wine tasting structured as an outreach event was conducted. Pinot noir wines sourced from the OSU Statewide Crop Load project were used for the tasting. This event included wine industry professionals from across Oregon who participated in a vertical tasting of nine wines produced by one project collaborator across three vintages (2015-2017). Participants tasted three flights of wines, including three wines from each vintage (low, moderate, and high crop levels), and recorded wine color, aroma, flavor, taste, and mouthfeel observations, as well as other relevant comments in an open-ended evaluation form. Responses were subject to thematic analyses, and results show no consistent preference for specific crop thinning levels across vintages. When wines were evaluated by crop level and outstanding sensory perception per vintage, there was no differentiation of wine sensory response by crop level for any vintage. However, wine preference was most associated with mouthfeel and fruit aroma characteristics, revealing wine weight, palate, and fruit-based aroma to be mentioned most by panelists throughout the tasting. &nbsp;Evaluation of this tasting event data shows that sensory attributes do not appear to be affected by cluster thinning practices within the vineyard, and winemaking style and vintage have greater influence. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Funding: &nbsp;Oregon Wine Research Institute and Erath Family Foundation Undergraduate Scholars Program, OSU Viticulture Extension, and Oregon Wine Board</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c36 c10" id="h.1l7c9vc1xb5g"><span class="c4">Advancing Smoke Taint Mitigation: The Potential Of Sulfur</span><span class="c14 c4">-Based Nutritional Approaches</span></h3><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8 c36"><span class="c0">Olivia Jefferies&sup1; and Elizabeth Tomasino&sup2;<br> &sup1;Graduate Research Assistant, &sup2;Professor, Department of Food Science and Technology, Oregon State University, 220 Wiegand Hall, 3051 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331.<br> *Corresponding Author: elizabeth.tomasino@oregonstate.edu</span></p><p class="c3 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8 c36"><span class="c0">Wildfire smoke presents an ever-growing challenge for the wine industry, threatening grape quality and winemaker livelihoods. When grapes in the vineyard are exposed to smoke, the resulting wines often develop an ashy, smoky flavor that compromises sensory quality. The underlying cause of this flavor has been linked to a combination of smoke-related compounds, specifically thiophenols and volatile phenols. While much is already being explored about these compounds and their impact, there is a growing need for practical solutions that can mitigate smoke exposure&rsquo;s effects during winemaking. Sulfur-containing nutrients, widely recognized for their role in enhancing varietal thiols&mdash;key aroma compounds in Sauvignon Blanc&mdash;may offer a potential avenue for addressing smoke taint. This research investigates the impact of sulfur-based nutrient additions on the concentration of smoke-derived compounds in wine. Smoke-exposed Pinot Noir grapes from Oregon were processed through micro fermentations with nutrient additions including glutathione, Glutastar, and diammonium phosphate (DAP). Two controls were included&mdash;one with smoke-exposed grapes and one with clean grapes. Using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS, concentrations of free phenols, phenol-glycosides, and thiols were measured. While nutrient additions did not directly alter smoke-related compound levels, all fermentations were successful, suggesting these treatments are compatible with winemaking.<br></span></p><p class="c7 c8 c36"><span class="c0">Funding: Not specified.</span></p><p class="c3 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c3 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c36 c34" id="h.asay71nfbgz4"><span class="c14 c31"></span></h3><h3 class="c7 c8 c36 c10" id="h.ebjnn5412ljh"><span class="c4">Developing Nondestructive Sensitive Detection For Smoke</span><span class="c14 c4">-Exposure Assessment In Wine Via Advanced Raman Spectroscopy</span></h3><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c8 c36"><span class="c0">Alec Sobotka&sup1;, Taylor D.

Several marker bands were found to be particularly enhanced, enabling guaiacol detection at lower concentrations than spontaneous Raman. Aided by quantum calculations, band assignments helped to elucidate key vibrational motions being enhanced. SERS strips with gold nanoparticles achieved guaiacol detection at parts-per-billion levels in synthetic wine but required higher thresholds in authentic wine. Various sample preparation methods were evaluated; the best guaiacol detection was achieved using LiChrolut-EN resin-packed columns with dichloromethane elution.

Enhanced plant defense responses were hypothesized to mitigate these effects via products eliciting systemic acquired resistance (Regalia) or induced systemic resistance (ISR; Actigard). This study evaluated these products on Cabernet franc vines at bloom, berry set, and veraison in 2023 and 2024. Significant treatment effects on GRBD symptoms at harvest (P = 0.039) were observed: lower expression in Regalia-treated vines (65%) and higher in Actigard-treated vines (75%) vs. the control (70%). The overall yield effect was significant (P = 0.015), driven by lower yield with Actigard (1.5 kg) and increased yield with Regalia (2.2 kg) compared to control (1.7 kg). Based on improved yields with Regalia, earlier applications at bud break and two weeks later were hypothesized to aid in berry set. In 2024, Regalia, Actigard, and an additional elicitor of ISR, Warhammer, were evaluated at this new application frequency (five times; budbreak through veraison). No effects were observed from the five-time application treatments on GRBD symptom expression (P = 0.46). Five-time Regalia applications increased yield by 41% (P = 0.10) but was statistically insignificant. These findings suggest Regalia modestly lowered symptom expression and significantly increased cluster numbers, but overall, treatments offered minimal benefit in mitigating broader fruit quality impacts of GRBD.<br><br>Funding: OSU-Agricultural Research Foundation</span></p><p class="c3 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c3 c36"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c19 c8 c36 c43" id="h.ouherktq32y4"><span class="c14 c23"></span></h2><h3 class="c22 c8 c10" id="h.7w3hi68mfflh"><span class="c14 c4">Kaolin Clay Reduces Water Stress, Fruit Sunburn, And Leafhopper Abundance In Oregon Vineyards</span></h3><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22 c8"><span>Cody R.

This material can benefit grape production across Oregon in a changing climate. Multiple field experiments were conducted from 2022 to 2024 in northeastern Oregon to evaluate water stress, observe fruit sunburn, and monitor leafhopper populations. In a Syrah vineyard, kaolin was applied between fruit set and harvest with varying rates (0, 11, 22, 45 kg ha</span><span class="c18">-1</span><span class="c0">). The effect on sunburn was tested with fruit zone leafing on the afternoon side of Syrah, Tempranillo, and Mourv&egrave;dre vines with kaolin applied to clusters prior to a post-v&eacute;raison (2023) and pre-v&eacute;raison (2024) heat events (&gt; 41&deg;C).

In 2023 and 2024, leaf temperatures trended lower and stomatal conductance trended higher with increasing application rate while leaf water potential was largely unchanged. The effects of kaolin on leaf temperature and stomatal conductance were mediated by increased leaf reflectance. In Syrah, Tempranillo, and Mourv&egrave;dre vines (2023&ndash;2024), kaolin application to clusters significantly reduced sunburn damage from extreme heat events. Kaolin treated clusters had up to 85% fewer shriveled berries, up to 34% fewer berries exhibiting sunburn browning, up to 11% fewer necrotic berries, and up to 25% higher anthocyanin concentration. In the organic Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard, kaolin application significantly reduced leaf nymph abundances but did not reduce the number of adults captured on yellow sticky traps. The peak second generation nymph abundances were 54 and 80% lower in kaolin treated vines in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Ultimately, nymph abundances were low compared to recommended treatment thresholds.</span></p><p class="c22 c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c22 c8"><span class="c0">Funding: Agricultural Research Foundation, Oregon Wine Research Institute, Western SARE</span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c21 c23"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c23"></span></p><h3 class="c7 c8 c10" id="h.t0xvo6hol6c7"><span class="c4">Investigation Of Cellulose Nanofiber</span><span class="c14 c4">-Based Films Used As A Protective Layer To Reduce Absorption Of Smoke Phenols Into Wine Grapes</span></h3><h3 class="c7 c8 c34 c10" id="h.t92hznphq88g"><span class="c14 c4"></span></h3><p class="c7 c8"><span>Lindsay Garcia</span><span class="c18">1</span><span>, Trung Tran</span><span class="c18">1</span><span>, Jooyeoun Jung</span><span class="c18">2</span><span>, Joseph B.

Chemical fungicides are typically used in disease management, but there are limited products that effectively manage GTDs. An alternative solution is biological control agents (BCAs). The flaw with BCAs is their range of efficacy, limited by regional and environmental conditions. Given that many of the current commercially available BCAs developed against GTDs are isolated from California and other regions, we hypothesize that BCAs native to the Pacific Northwest may exhibit improved performance related to adaptation to the local conditions. To test this, we collected 200 spur samples from eight vineyards in the Willamette and Rogue Valleys in Oregon and isolated the microbes from them. We then plated samples on a variety of media selective for known BCA species, and isolated distinct cultures based on colony morphology. Isolates were then stored for later use and characterized using genetic identification, and only one isolate per sample of each species was collected. We found the potential BCAs: </span><span class="c11">Aureobasidium, Bacillus, Cladosporium, Pseudomonas, Rhodotorula, </span><span>and </span><span class="c11">Trichoderma </span><span>in 95%, 62%, 79%, 95%, 62%, and 6% of samples respectively, as well as 97 isolates of potential GTD causing fungi.

Delayed pruning and pruning wound protectants are effective strategies to manage GTDs. However, late pruning is often not possible in Oregon due to labor, and rain is ever present. A study was conducted to assess the impact of pruning timing and necessity of repeated fungicide applications. The project was conducted in the Willamette Valley and Rogue Valley over two years. Vines were pruned in either December, January or February and treated with a pruning would protectant (Topsin or VitiSeal) the day of pruning and either just that day or had repeat applications monthly through February. </span><span class="c11">Dothiorella iberica</span><span>&nbsp;at 2.5 x 10</span><span class="c18">4 </span><span>spores/ml was spray-inoculated on treated wounds during each pruning date. Spur tissues were sampled in August and cultured in half strength PDA amended with antibiotics for pathogen isolation. Percent recovery of </span><span class="c11">D. iberica</span><span>&nbsp;was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance. In all pruning months, one application of Topsin reduced pathogen recovery as much as repeated applications with average recovery ranging from 0 to 18.8%. Three times (12%) and two times (19.3%) application of VitiSeal reduced pathogen recovery compared to one time application (29.7%) and non-treated control (57.3%) in December. Pathogen recovery was similar in two- and one- time application of VitiSeal in January but was lower than the non-treated control. For February samples, the single VitiSeal application reduced pathogen recovery compared to the non-treated control. Fruit yield and pruning weight were not affected by the treatments applied in any of the pruning timings. Results suggest that a single Topsin application post-pruning is sufficient to reduce </span><span class="c11">D. iberica</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;infections while repeated applications of VitiSeal are required to reduce pathogen recovery compared to single application.</span></p><p class="c22 c8"><span class="c0">Funded by: Oregon Wine Board</span></p><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c51 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c14 c58">Thank you for being a part of the </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c14 c58">Oregon Wine Research Institute </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c35 c46">Grape Da</span><span class="c35 c58">y!</span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 209.45px; height: 69.47px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 209.45px; height: 69.47px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c14 c39"></span></p><p class="c7 c28"><span class="c21 c4"></span></p><p class="c19 c81"><span class="c31 c35 c38">owri.oregonstate.edu</span></p></body></html>
